# Outcomes

- set up local environment
- generated a new skeleton application
- added bootstrap and some CSS styling tags
- added an navigation bar using bootstrap
- created and nested components
- understood the hierarchy of components as the order of components invocation
- created basic routing
- understood how routes, modules, components, view pages, browser, URL are stitched together
- used HTML tags, bootstrap class properties and decoration to create rows, columns, tables, boxes, dropdown, toggles, etc
- used *ngFor directive to dynamically render data onto the view page
- defined dataset name, type and values in OnInit of component; assigned each dataset as an attribute using ngOninit lifecycle
- used ngFor directive, property binding, nested ngFor to dynamically render data component onto the html view page
- understood how data defined, stored in component interacts with HTML view page
- understood what interpolation binding, property binding, event binding, and two-way binding do
- implemented code to dynamically render data from component onto HTML view page using interpolation binding and ternary logic
- implemented code for event listening and conditionally execute css property using ternary logic and property binding
- used *ngIf, *ngIf-else, and *ng-template to conditionally render HTML content on the view page
- used pipes to transform strings, currency, dates, json, and other data types for display in conjunctions of using interpolation binding
- understood what module is, what it does, why use it, and how to create and use one
- generated new modules, re-organized application structure, incorporated, imported, exported components
- fixed issues related to current and parent directory with importing modules after restructuring application structure
- understood why using service as a class object to handle business logic and data received
- understood how to create service class, make it available locally or globally, inject it into component
- understood the concept of dependency injection, @injection decorator, ProvidedIn, constructor()
- understood the concept of module and component in the context of Angular
- understood concept of AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and Xml), request, response, client, and server
- understood the data flow from database to web API to Angular Service object, component, observable using the concept of AJAX
- implemented GET request in angular project using service, component, httpClient, model class
- started NPM backend server, made request call to the backend endpoint, retrieved and stored data in response in component, rendered onto view HTML page
- verified and understood the structure of request response objects in the browser devTool
- implemented POST request using form module, boostrap, module binding, service class, parse response, send input data, clear input value
- implemented PUT operation, creating new parameters, temporary properties, even listener, event binding, indexing, handling response, rendering view page 
- understood further how PUT operation is completed using observable class, service class, httpClient PUT, properties in component, event binding, property binding, model binding
- implemented DELETE operation making AJAX call, passing object id, variables, handle response, slice object from array, update view page
- understood how delete operation is executed step by step in service class, component, and view HTML page
